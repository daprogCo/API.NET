## 👤 About Me

👋 Hi, I'm **David Savard** — a **Power Platform Developer** at **CGI**, with **over two years** of professional experience building business applications, automations, and custom solutions.

🎓 I also completed a **Data Engineer** formation at **Collège Bois-de-Boulogne**, where I deepened my understanding of data infrastructure, ETL pipelines, and cloud technologies.

This project is my personal challenge to break into **C#** and **.NET** development—because growth happens outside the comfort zone. 💪

## 🎯 Project Goal

Create a fully functional **API** using **C#** and **.NET**, inspired by the book:  
📘 [*Programming APIs with C# and .NET*](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/programming-apis-with-c-and-net-9781803231099) by *Packt*.

## 🗓️ Timeline

- **Start Date:** October 7th, 2025  
- **Target Completion:** **November 15th, 2025**

⏱️ That gives me just **under 40 days** to go from novice to deploying a live API!

---

## 🔥 Adding Some Spice

To raise the stakes, I'm not just building this API locally.  
I'm also planning to:

- 🛠️ Set up a **CI/CD pipeline** using either:
  - Jenkins  
  - Azure DevOps *(TBD)*  
- 📦 **Containerize** the API  
- 🚀 **Deploy it to my Hostinger VPS**  
- 🌐 Make it publicly accessible at:  
  **[`https://daprog.co/api.net-project`](https://daprog.co/api.net-project)**

## 🤓 The Catch?

I **barely know** C# or .NET right now...  
But that’s what makes this challenge *awesome*.

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

This isn’t just a project—it’s a **learning journey**.  
From zero to deploying an API in production, while mastering:

- C# syntax and best practices  
- .NET Core fundamentals  
- API design and architecture  
- DevOps workflows and automation  
- Docker containerization

## 📌 Stay Tuned

More updates to come. Let’s see how far I can go in just over a month!  
**Challenge accepted.**
